# matt-portfolio

Welcome — and get to know Matt.

This is my personal developer site, built to showcase backend projects, technical experiments, and the logic behind every fix. It’s a digital workspace where I document Python internals, deployment pipelines, and classic data structure implementations — all with a creative twist.

Coming soon — this site will be deployed as a static build with linked project pages and contact info.

## 🧠 What You'll Find

- **Contact**: How to reach me via email, GitHub, or LinkedIn

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML & CSS for layout and styling
